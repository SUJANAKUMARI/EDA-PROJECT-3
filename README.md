# Project Title

Exploratory Data Analysis of Housing Data

## Dependencies

Downloads: Jupyter Notebook. 

Libraries to be imported: 

1.  Pandas.
2.  Numpy.
3.  Matplotlib.
4.  SNS.

## DATA  DESCRIPTION

1.  SOURCE OF HOUSING DATA:  The data used for the analysis is provided by Next Hikes.

2.  FEATURES/VARIABLES INCLUDED:  There are around 81 features and variables included in the data.   The most common and important variables include Total living area in square feet, No of bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, Garage capacity etc.

3.  DATA SIZE AND FORMAT:  The data has around 1460 rows and 81 columns in the form of csv.

##  Methodology

1.  Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
	a. Importing the Dataset.
	b. Displaying the First Few Rows of Data
	c. Basic Summary Statistics (mean, median, min, max, etc.)

2.  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
	a. Handling Missing Values.
	b. Removing Duplicates.
	c. Checking for Data Integrity Issues.

3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	a. Univariate Analysis:  Conduct a univariate analysis to understand the distribution of key variables 	like house prices. Utilize histograms, kernel density plots, or other visualizations to gain insights into the data.

	b. Multivariate Analysis:  Perform multivariate analysis to understand the correlations and 	dependencies between various features. Utilize techniques like
orrelation matrices or scatterplot matrices for a comprehensive view.

5.  Feature Engineering:  Introduce new variables that might enhance the model's ability to predict house prices. For instance, calculate the price per square foot or engineer a feature representing the property's age.


6. Feature Engineering and Size Impact:  Explore relationships between key features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) and house prices. Identify how these features collectively contribute to the valuation.


7. Market Trends and Historical Pricing: Analyse the dataset temporally, looking at trends in house prices over different periods. Understand how external factors, such as economic indicators, may have influenced these trends.

8. Customer Preferences and Amenities:  Examine the dataset to understand how specific amenities (e.g., swimming pool, garage) impact house prices. Analyse customer
feedback or reviews to gauge the perceived value of these amenities.
